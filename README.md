# Installing the WordPress Plugin 

## Step 1: Download the Plugin
- Obtain the `.zip` file of the plugin from the official source (developer website, marketplace, etc.).
- Ensure the file is not extracted; WordPress requires a `.zip` file for upload.

## Step 2: Log in to WordPress Admin Panel
- Open your web browser and go to:
  yourwebsite.com/wp-admin
- Enter your **username** and **password** to access the dashboard.

## Step 3: Upload the Plugin
1. In the left menu, go to **Plugins** > **Add New**.
2. Click the **Upload Plugin** button at the top.
3. Click **Choose File**, select the `.zip` file you downloaded, and then click **Install Now**.

## Step 4: Activate the Plugin
- After installation, click the **Activate Plugin** button.
- The plugin is now active on your website.

## Step 5: Configure the Plugin (If Required)
- Some plugins require additional setup.
- Navigate to **Settings** or look for a new menu item added by the plugin.

## Troubleshooting
- If the upload fails, ensure the `.zip` file is not corrupted.
- Check your WordPress and PHP version compatibility.
- If the file size exceeds limits, increase the upload size in `php.ini` or use FTP.
